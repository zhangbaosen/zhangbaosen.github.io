<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with power
system transient stability analysis using computer software tools. In
this lab, you will learn the basic concepts of transient stability and
associated assessment methods. Case studies will be performed for you to
understand the nature of the power system transient stability behavior,
including generator 'swing' characteristics and associated voltage and
power oscillation dynamics. Through this lab, you will gain an improved
understanding on the various factors that affect the transient stability
of power systems.</p>

<h2>1.1 Background</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 Power System Transient Stability</h3>
<p>Transient stability is the ability of a power system to remain in
synchronism when subjected to large transient disturbances. These
disturbances may include faults on transmission elements, loss of load,
loss of generation, or loss of system components such as transformers or
transmission lines. Although many different forms of power system
stability have emerged and become problematic in recent years, transient
stability still remains a basic and important consideration in power
system design and operation. While it is true that the operation of many
power systems is limited by phenomena such as voltage stability or
small-signal stability, most systems are prone to transient instability
under certain conditions or contingencies and hence the understanding
and analysis of transient stability remain fundamental issues. Also,
transient instability can occur in a very short time frame (a few
seconds), leaving no time for operator intervention to mitigate
problems. It is therefore essential to deal with the problem in the
design stage or severe operating restrictions may result.</p>
<p>Following a disturbance, synchronous machine frequencies undergo
transient deviations from synchronous frequency and power angles change.
The objective of transient stability study is to determine whether or
not the machines will return to synchronous frequency with new
steady-state power angles. In many cases, transient stability is
determined using “swing curves” plotted for a generator subjected to a
particular system disturbance. Trace “a” shown below shows that the
generator power angle recovers and oscillates around a new equilibrium
point. It is deemed to be transiently stable. However, in trace “b”, the
power angle increases aperiodically and is considered transiently
unstable. What factors determine whether a machine will be stable or
unstable? How can the stability of large power systems be analyzed? If a
case is unstable, what can be done to enhance stability? These are some
of the questions to be solved in this lab.</p>

<h3>1.1.2 Methods of Transient stability Analysis</h3>
<p>You may have learned the theory of swing equation and equal area
criterion in the lecture. It can be used to conduct analytical studies
on small systems. For a practical system with large numbers of
generators, transmission units and loads, the time-domain based
simulation method is a more applicable approach.</p>
<p>For stability assessment, the power system is normally represented
using a positive sequence model. The network is represented by a
traditional positive sequence power flow model that defines the
transmission topology, line reactances, connected loads and generation,
and pre-disturbance voltage profile.</p>
<p>Generators can be represented with various levels of detail, selected
based on such factors as length of simulation, severity of disturbance,
and accuracy required. The most basic model for synchronous generators
consists of a constant internal voltage behind a constant transient
reactance, and the rotating inertia constant. This is the so-called
classical representation that neglects the machine physical construction
factors (damper windings, saturation, etc), the generation controls
(excitation and governor systems) and the details of the prime mover.
More detailed models have been utilized in commercial transient
stability programs.</p>
<p>Transient stability studies are commonly performed after power flow
studies. Based on the pre- disturbance system profiles, time-domain
simulation can be conducted. The results are examined, usually through a
graphical plotting, to determine if the system remains stable and to
assess the details of the dynamic behavior of the system. Typical
procedures for the transient stability analysis are as follows.</p>

<p>The following software is installed on the computers that are
provided in the laboratory. The following installation instructions are
provided if you care to install the software on your own computers. It
is your responsibility to get this working on your own hardware as
little support will be provided by the laboratory staff as it can become
too time consuming. Both Matlab/Simulink and the PSAT toolbox should be
able to be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux.</p>

system)</p>
<h2>2.1 PSAT Familiarization</h2>
<p>PSAT is a free Matlab toolbox for electric power system analysis and
control. It includes power flow, continuation power flow, optimal power
flow, small signal stability analysis and time domain simulation. All
operations can be assessed by means of graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
and a Simulink-based library provides a user friendly tool for network
design.</p>
<h3>2.1.1 Load the Basecase</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the .zip file from below which contains the Base Case that
will be used for this lab and extract it somewhere you can find in your
user space. It is usually easiest if you put the file in your default
Matlab workspace. The extracted .zip file contains a single .mdl file
titled <code>Lab_4_Basecase.mdl</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uf4g9xv2ml177v0bqxbp1/Lab_4_Basecase.mdl?rlkey=vg4fegltuppf156eig301gbwb&amp;dl=1">Base Case Download</a></h4>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the PSAT command window click on the <code>Open Data File</code>
button as shown below or navigate the menus to
<code>File/Open/Data File</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/v3g4cabmcxgau3moeygge/open_data_file.png?rlkey=q0v2aaoym174gi0m4zif1skc1&amp;dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>figure 6. Open Data file button.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>From the opened Load Data File screen, navigate the directory
structure to where you have the .mdl file extracted. Make sure that the
Filters is to <code>PSAT Simulink (.mdl)</code> and select the correct
Basecase file under <code>Files in current path:</code> and then click
on the <code>Load</code> button.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The mdl file contains the single-line 9-bus
system diagram in a Simulink file format which was constructed with the
PSAT simulink library. When we <code>Load Data file</code>, PSAT
extracts the data from the Simulink and creates another file which ends
with a <code>.m</code>, which it then uses in its simulation
calculations. You can review some of this conversion process in the
Matlab Command Window.</p>

<p>figure 7. Load a simulink .mdl file into the PSAT
toolbox for analysis.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>To view and/or edit the single-line diagram of the system in
Simulink, you can go to <code>File/Open/Simulink Model</code> and open
the same downloaded .mdl file.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you make changes to the Simulink model you
need to first save the new model in the .mdl format and then make sure
that you <code>Load Data file</code> in PSAT before carrying out any
simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Simulink library blocks may have an
Unrecognized functions or variables error and are highlighted in red. As
we are not using the Simulink solver this does not matter. If the red
highlight bothers you, you can try simulating the model in Simulink,
nothing will really simulate but it will create the missing variables
and the errors will go away.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can double click on the blocks in the
model to edit their <code>Block Parameters</code>.</p>

<h2>2.2 Transient Stability Analysis</h2>
<p>Transient stability examines the impact of disturbances on power
systems considering the operating conditions. The analysis of the
dynamic behavior of power systems for the transient stability gives
information about the ability of a power system to sustain synchronism
during and after a disturbance.</p>
<p>In this task, a fault will be placed on one of the buses to
demonstrate how the system behaves. A system can recover if a fault is
cleared quickly enough before the whole system collapses.</p>

   the power angle (δ) of the 3 generators when the system goes
   unstable.

<h3>2.2.1 Postlab Questions</h3>
<p>Is the system stable? Explain why.</p>
<p>Explain what is occurring in the generator plots for both the voltage and the power, that you obtained, when a fault is applied to bus 4 between 1.0 to 1.15 seconds of the simulation.</p>
<h2>2.3 Impact of Fault Location</h2>
<p>The amount of time a fault is sustained before the system collapses
can vary depending on where in the system the fault occurs. Therefore
the system’s critical fault clearing time should be different if a fault
occurs in a different location (ie. on a different bus).</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>
<p>Using a similar procedure as the previous section to complete the
table below, determine the systems critical fault clearing time when a
single fault occurs at each of the 9 buses. Record your results in the
table provided on your results sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You already completed bus 4 in the previous
section.</p>

<h3>2.3.1 Postlab Questions</h3>
<p>Which fault location is most susceptible to cause a system
transient that will lead to an unstable system? What are the potential
reasons for that?</p>
<p>Explain why doing a fault location scan, like was completed in
the lab, could be useful.</p>
<h2>2.4 Impact of Line Tripping</h2>
<p>If a circuit breaker protecting a transmission line trips either
before or during a fault event the critical fault clearing time will be
effected.</p>
<p>For this case, we will start with the same case that we used in the
<code>Transient Stability Analysis</code> where we had a fault on bus 4.
However for this new case we will add a breaker in the line from bus 7
to bus 8 that will open before the fault occurs and then close again
after the fault transient has subsided. The goal of this task is to see
how a change in the system effects the critical fault clearing time.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Add a Breaker to the line from bus 7 to bus 8 by doing the
following.
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the <code>.mdl</code> file that you saved in the
<code>Transient Stability Analyses</code> section where you just added a
fault on bus 4 into Simulink. As this is the case we want to compare
to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the PSAT Simulink library and copy a <code>Breaker</code>
from the <code>Faults &amp; Breakers</code> catalogue someone near
either bus 7 or bus 8 in your base case.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>figure 23. A Breaker in the Faults and Breaker
catalogue of the PSAT Simulink library.</p>
<pre><code>3. Delete the wire connecting the bus to the line element and place the
   new Breaker in series with the line by wiring the breaker to both the
   line element and the appropriate bus.

<pre><code>4. Double click on the `Breaker` element and the
   `Block Parameters` for the `Breaker` will open.
   Set the parameters as shown below.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>5. Save the new case with a new appropriate name as a `.mdl`
   file.
</code></pre>
<p>18. Load the newly saved file into PSAT using the PSAT command
window.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Like you did in the previous sections, determine the system’s new
critical fault clearing time when the newly added Breaker is open.
Record your results in the table provided on your results
sheet.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.4.1 Postlab Questions</h3>
<p>How does a line being removed from the system effect the systems transient stability? Explain.</p>
<h2>2.5 Impact of Inertia</h2>
<p>The inertia of a generator will effect how fast the power angle
changes when a transient occurs which means that it will either take
longer or shorter for that generator to reach the point of instability
depending if the inertia is increased or decreased.</p>
<p>For this case, we will again start with the same case that we used in
the <code>Transient Stability Analysis</code> where we had a fault on
bus 4. However for this new case we will increase the inertia of all
three of the generators of the system to demonstrate its effect on the
critical fault clearing time.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>For this test we are going to double the inertia of all three of
the generators in the system. Follow the steps below to change the
inertia of a generator.
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start again by reopening the <code>.mdl</code> file that you
saved in the <code>Transient Stability Analyses</code> section where you
just added a fault on bus 4 into Simulink. As this is the case that we
want to compare to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double click the generator to open the
<code>Block Parameter</code> window. Double the <code>Inertia</code>
value that is shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can use math in the parameters so you can
simply add a 2* infront of the inertia parameter to double it.</p>

<pre><code>3. Modify all 3 generators so that their inertia is
   doubled.

4. Save the new case with a new appropriate name as a
   `.mdl` file.

<ol start="21">
<li>
<p>Load the newly saved file into PSAT using the PSAT command
window.</p>

<li>
<p>Like you did in the previous sections, determine the systems new
critical fault clearing time when the systems generators inertia are all
doubled. Record your results in the table provided on your results
sheet.</p>

<h3>2.5.1 Postlab Questions</h3>
<p>How does the inertia of all of the generators in the system
effect the systems transient stability? Explain.</p>
