I joined the department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington as an Assistant Professor in 2015. My research interests are in the area of cyberphysical and power systems,  spanning from control/optimization, statistics and machine learning to power electronics. If you are interested in any of these, I'm sure we can find things to chat about. My CV is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g34fbv4yjnc6xml/Baosen%20Zhang%20CV.pdf?dl=1).

I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley in 2013, where I worked with [David Tse](https://web.stanford.edu/~dntse/) and my thesis is [here](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-146.html). I was a postdoc at Stanford, jointly hosted by [Ramesh Johari](http://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal). I received my undergraduate degree in [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) (Electrical Option) from the University of Toronto.
