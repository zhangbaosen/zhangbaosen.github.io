    <h2 id="course-information">Course Information</h2>
<p>Time and Location: MW 10:30am-12pm, BAG 331A <br />
Instructor: Baosen Zhang, zhangbao@uw.edu <br />
Office hour: ECE M310,
Website: The main website is <a href="http://zhangbaosen.github.io/teaching/EE554">http://zhangbaosen.github.io/teaching/EE554</a>. We use the Canvas website for grading and homework submissions.</p>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description:</h2>
<p>This course introduces the operation of large-scale power systems from a modern point of view. We will define and discuss the major problems in power system analysis, operations, and economics. We will talk about different formulations and tools that are commonly used in practice, and how they are changing when large amount of renewable resources are present in the grid. The open problems and current approaches are discussed in each of the these topics. No previous power engineering background is required. Familiarity with linear algebra and calculus is assumed.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisite(s)</h2>
<p>This class requires a good background in linear algebra and calculus, for example, experience in working with matrices. Prior exposure to power engineering is not required.</p>

<h2 id="textbooks">Textbook(s)</h2>
<p>The course follows parts of ``Power System Analysis, A Mathematical Approach’’ by Steven Low. It can accessed at <a href="https://netlab.caltech.edu/book_reg/">https://netlab.caltech.edu/book_reg/</a>. Please note that this book is still in the draft stage and you may need to register to receive a free copy.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>Homework Assignments: Weekly homework assignments</p>

<h2 id="grade-distribution">Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Homework, 80%</li>
  <li>Class Participation, 20%</li>
  <li>Bonus points for finding typos and mistakes in the book</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may use whatever language you are comfortable with, e.g. Matlab, Python, Julia, C++,… There will be questions where you have to use a computer.</li>
  <li>You may use AI tools such as ChatGPT or Copilot. Please clearly indicate how these are used in your homework solutions. Please remember that you’re ultimately responsible for the answers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="large-course-objectives">large Course Objectives</h2>
<p>At the completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand common power system models</li>
  <li>Understand the purpose of various analysis tools used in large power systems</li>
  <li>Implement some of these algorithms</li>
  <li>Identify open questions in power system operations</li>
  <li>Improve your oral and written communication skills</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

<h3 id="late-homework-assignments-will-not-be-accepted-without-permission-from-the-instructor">Late homework assignments will not be accepted without permission from the instructor.</h3>

<h3 id="ai-tools-and-academic-integrity">AI Tools and Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>AI content generators, such as ChatGPT, present opportunities that can contribute to your learning and academic work. If you use such tools, you must clearly state where they are used and how they contributed to your work. Otherwise, using these technologies may violate academic standards of the University.</p>

<h3 id="disabled-students">Disabled Students</h3>
<p>If you have a documented disability and wish to discuss academic accommodations, please contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS), a unit within the Division of Student Life at UW. They will inform me and I’m happy to make reasonable accommodation.</p>

<h3 id="conduct">Conduct</h3>
<p>The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable as they pursue their academic goals. Allegations of misconduct by students may be referred to the appropriate campus office for investigation and resolution. More information can be found online at <a href="https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/">https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="academic-honesty-policy-summary">Academic Honesty Policy Summary</h3>
<p>I expect every member of the class to conform to the highest standards of academic integrity. Cheating can result in failure of the course and/or eventual expulsion from the University. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/academic-misconduct/">https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/academic-misconduct/</a>.
Because your homework has a bearing on your grade, it must be your own original work. You may compare homework answers and discuss problem solving methods with other students in the class, but the final result - the work you hand in - must consist of work that you, and you only, have performed. Copying homework done by someone else, or copying old homework or the answer key, copying the work of anyone else on examinations, the use of unauthorized notes or other unauthorized aids during examinations, and knowingly permitting your work to be copied for the purpose of cheating are all examples of cheating.</p>

<h3 id="medical-excuse-notes">Medical Excuse Notes</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend class and to participate in all graded activities. To protect student privacy and the integrity of the academic experience, students will not be required to provide a medical excuse note to justify an absence from class due to illness. A student absent from any graded class activity or examination due to illness must request, in writing, to take a rescheduled examination or perform work judged by the instructor to be the equivalent. Students are responsible for taking any number of examinations for which they are scheduled on a given day and may not request an adjustment for this reason alone.</p>

<h3 id="religious-accommodations">Religious Accommodations</h3>
<p>Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at <a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/">Religious Accommodations Policy</a>.</p>
