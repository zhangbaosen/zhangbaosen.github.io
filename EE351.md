# Note:
1. Most of the lectures will be done via the board. There are slides associated with each class, but they mainly *highlight* the material covered and do not include all of the material covered on the board. It is your responsibility to make sure that you take down sufficient notes in class.
2. I will try to respond to emails within 24 hours. Remember, the TAs often reply much faster than I do.
